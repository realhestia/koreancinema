# Korean Cinema


## Introduction

The datasets were obtained on March 20, 2020 from the [KOREA Box-office Information System](http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/main/main.do) (KOBIS). The system is run by the Korean Film Council (KOFIC), a government-supported, self-administered organization aiming to promote Korean films at home and abroad. 

Through analyzing the Top 500 high-grossing films in the country as well as the annual statistics, we hope to explore the trend and patterns in the South Korean film market and look at the challenge it faces.
