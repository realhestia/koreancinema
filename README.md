## Introduction

The datasets were obtained on March 20, 2020 from the [KOREA Box-office Information System](http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/main/main.do) (KOBIS). The system is run by the Korean Film Council (KOFIC), a government-supported, self-administered organization aiming to promote Korean films at home and abroad. 

Through analyzing the Top 500 high-grossing films in the country as well as the annual statistics, we hope to explore the trend and patterns in the South Korean film market and look at the challenge it faces.


## Limitations

The information in the dataset was based on the statistics in the Korean Movie Yearbook (1971 ~ 2010) and calculation at regular intervals (monthly, yearly) since 2011. Depending on the statistical closing cycle and re-releases of films, official statistics are subject to change.

The historical box office information only reflects the statistics calculated by the previous month. Real-time statistics, especially those of the newly released films in 2020, can be found at the [Yearly Box Office List](http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/stat/boxs/findYearlyBoxOfficeList.do).
